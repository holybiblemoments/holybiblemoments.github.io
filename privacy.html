    <p><strong>Data Protection and Security</strong></p>
    <p>
      Holy Bible Moments solemnly promises that we will never share your
      personal information with any organization outside of Holy Bible Moments
      without your express authorization. We will only share it if we are
      satisfied that accessing, using, storing, or disclosing it is reasonable
      and necessary in circumstances including, but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Complying with laws, regulations, judicial proceedings, or lawful
        requests from government agencies;
      </li>
      <li>
        Enforcing our Terms of Use, including the investigation of potential
        violations;
      </li>
      <li>
        Detecting, preventing, or resolving fraud, security breaches, or
        technical difficulties;
      </li>
      <li>
        As required or authorized by law, to prevent imminent harm and to
        protect our products, the site, and the property and safety of our users
        or the public.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To ensure the security of your information, Holy Bible Moments has
      implemented strict security measures to guard against unauthorized access,
      modification, disclosure, or destruction of data. This covers strict
      scrutiny of Holy Bible Moments 's internal data collection, storage, and
      processing processes, as well as physical-level security measures designed
      to prevent unauthorized access to personal information storage systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless we have your express permission, we strictly limit access to
      personal information to those employees, contractors, and agents who need
      to know that information to operate, develop, and optimize Holy Bible
      Moments's services. These persons are bound by a confidentiality agreement
      and will be held liable for any breach.
    </p>
    <p>
      During your use of Holy Bible Moments's products and services, we are
      committed to providing you with easy access to and management of your
      personal information, including the correction of any inaccurate data or
      deletion of relevant data at your request (unless required by law or
      necessary to be retained for legitimate service purposes). Before
      responding to these requests, Holy Bible Moments will ask each user to
      verify their identity and clearly specify the specific information to be
      accessed, corrected, or deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may refuse to process the following types of requests: requests that
      are unreasonably repetitive, systematic, technically infeasible,
      potentially invasive of another's privacy, extremely impractical, and
      other non-essential access requests. We always adhere to the principle of
      fairness and reasonableness to ensure the propriety of the information
      handling process.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Information of Children</strong></p>
    <p>
      Holy Bible Moments is committed to not knowingly collecting any personally
      identifiable information from children under the age of 16 (or the legal
      age of consent under applicable law) and will not actively allow such
      persons to register on the Holy Bible Moments Platform. As soon as we
      become aware that personal information has been collected from a child
      under the age of legal consent without the consent of a parent or legal
      guardian, we will take immediate action to suspend the account in question
      and completely delete the information to ensure strict protection of
      children's privacy.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong></p>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to change, modify, or otherwise adjust this policy at
      any time at our sole discretion. To remain transparent about our latest
      privacy practices, we encourage you to visit and review the most current
      version of the Privacy Policy in our application at any time. We recommend
      that you check this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed of any
      potential changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are dissatisfied with or do not agree to any changes to this
      policy, you have the right to immediately stop using our application.
      However, once any updates or modifications to this policy are posted and
      you continue to access or use any of our gaming services, you will be
      deemed to have accepted and agreed to these revised terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that it is our strict policy that no employee or agent is
      authorized to make unauthorized changes to the content of our policies.
      All adjustments to our policies must be announced and take effect through
      official channels.

    <h1><strong>Terms of Service</strong></h1>
    <p><strong>Overview of Terms of Service</strong></p>
    <p>
      Holy Bible Moments, "We," "us," "the Company," "the Game Developers," "our
      Games," "Application," or "the Application" refers to the entity providing
      the services. This Agreement details your rights and obligations with
      respect to your use of the Application and related services.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Acceptance of Terms</strong></p>
    <p>
      By actively downloading, installing, accessing, or utilizing our games,
      content, activities, and all related services (collectively, the
      "Services"), you expressly indicate that you have fully read, understood,
      and voluntarily accept all of the provisions of these Terms. If you do not
      agree with any of the terms or conditions of these Terms, we respectfully
      request that you do not download, install, access, or utilize the
      Application and its associated Services.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Additional Terms and Platform Requirements</strong></p>
    <p>
      Please note that our Application download/purchase pages may contain
      certain additional terms, conditions, and requirements that supplement
      these Terms. In addition, if you are downloading/purchasing the
      Application from a mobile platform, we recommend that you carefully review
      the terms and conditions of that platform, as they may contain additional
      provisions or requirements for your download, installation, and use of the
      Application through that platform. These additional provisions will also
      apply to your use and, together with these Terms, constitute the entire
      agreement governing your use of the Service.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><strong>Installation, Access, and Using the Services</strong></h2>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for selecting an appropriate Internet
      connection and for paying all charges that may be associated with
      accessing or using our Services. Before taking advantage of the Services,
      it is recommended that you check with your mobile carrier or Internet
      service provider to clarify the specific charges for wireless or data
      connection services, details of service packages, and other conditions of
      use. Please note that we cannot ensure that our service is compatible with
      all wireless service plans or will work effectively in all geographic
      locations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, we cannot guarantee that the Application will work seamlessly
      on all devices, including the availability and full functional performance
      of all its features, nor do we promise that the Service will remain
      accessible at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before deciding to download the Application, please check whether the
      Application supports your preferred language version. We wish to make it
      clear that the Application may not be available in all languages, and
      there is no guarantee that all languages will be covered in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not obligated to provide you with any updates, additions, or
      subsequent versions of the Application. We reserve the right to modify or
      discontinue any portion of the Services at any time, in our sole
      discretion, with or without prior notice. We reserve the right to add or
      remove features and functionality to the Application. If we release a new
      version of the Application or introduce new features, we may require you
      to update the Application installed on your device. These updates may be
      performed automatically, or a notification may be sent to you before they
      are performed. For major updates, additions, or new versions of the
      Application, we may also require you to carefully review and accept our
      terms, as applicable, which may be updated, before you install and begin
      using the updated or new version of the Application. If you do not agree
      to the new terms, you may not install or use the updated or new version of
      the Application and should immediately stop using the Application and any
      related services, and uninstall and remove the Application from your
      device. Please note that our obligation to support previous versions of
      the Application will end with the release of a major update, supplement,
      or subsequent version of the Application.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Application may integrate data location functionality provided by
      third-party vendors, which is primarily intended to support the basic
      navigation needs of the Application and ensure its proper functioning.
      However, it should be clear that the Application is not designed or
      intended to be used as a professional navigation tool requiring highly
      accurate location data. Accordingly, you are solely responsible for any
      injury, damage, or loss resulting from improper use of the Application's
      data location features. Neither we nor any third-party providers provide
      any warranty or guarantee of any kind regarding the availability,
      real-time availability, completeness, or accuracy of the location data in
      the Application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wireless and wired networks are inherently insecure when transmitting
      information. While we have implemented a variety of tools and technical
      means in an effort to protect your personal information from unauthorized
      access or disclosure, please be aware that we cannot guarantee the
      absolute confidentiality of your personal information and private
      communications in the course of using our applications or related
      services. Therefore, you are solely responsible for the security risks and
      potential damages that may result from Internet transmissions. It is also
      your responsibility to take all reasonable and recommended security
      measures (e.g., setting complex passwords, etc.) to enhance the security
      of your device and prevent unauthorized access.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Services are intended to provide users with a platform for learning,
      gaming, and entertainment, and are not intended to be used as a
      professional tool for medical diagnosis, prevention, treatment, or
      assessment of health conditions. You should be expressly aware that the
      Services are not designed to be a substitute for professional medical care
      or professional advice for an individual's health condition. In addition,
      the activities referred to in the Services or products may not be suitable
      for all people, and you therefore use the Services at your own risk and
      responsibility to ensure that the activities you select are appropriate
      for your individual condition and health status.
    </p>
